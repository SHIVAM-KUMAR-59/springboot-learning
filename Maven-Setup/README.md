# Maven Setup

## Maven is a dependency manager for Java projects, it helps keep track of the dependencies and their versions being used in the project

**Archetype**: Custom templates that we can create to build a particular projects.

- **`pom.xml` contains the dependency packages**
- **A package has 3 things: `groupId`, `artifactId` and `version`**
- `MVN Repository` is one of the sources to get the dependencies, just copy from there and paste in `pom.xml`
